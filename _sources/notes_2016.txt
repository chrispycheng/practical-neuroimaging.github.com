Day 0: (survey)
       introduction to Python
       an image as an array
       (Announce mid term project examples)

Day 1: 2D/3D arrays and plotting

Day 2: Git / 4D arrays and masking / ROI

Day 3: Diagnostics, array manipulation, testing
       [homework on testing]

Day 4: First statistics / correlation
       [mid-term project starts]

Day 5: HRF modeling (single event modeling)

Day 6: Regression + GLM
       [hand in mid-term projects]

Day 7: T, F, inference
       [Prepare final project proposals]

Day 8: Modeling, model selection. Project prosal feedback

Day 9: Slice timing / 1D interpolation

Day 10: Optimization, 2D interpolation

Day 11: Coordinate systems, cross-modality registration

Day 12: Cross-subject registration / project presentations

Possible mid-term project:
        * model diagnostic
        * effect size / power
        * Motion estimates - center of mass
        * ROI signal analyis, signal to noise ratio
        * Jeanette's single event analysis
        * Diagnostics with PCA.
