We are going to start getting used to the `git`_ version control system this
week.

Git is an essential tool for anyone using code and data, and you will find
yourself using this tool all the time, so it is important to invest time
learning how to use git.

To use git, it is very important to understand the basic ideas behind it.

Git uses *hashes* a great deal.  To get the background for these, read this very
short introduction to :doc:`cryptographic_hashes`.

Next, please read the `git parable`_ |--| an excellent introduction to the ideas
behind git.  I suggest you read this in conjunction with the :download:`slides
from a talk by Johan Herland <git_parable_johan_herland.pdf>` |--| Johan's
slides illustrate the text in the git parable.  You should start at slide 10 of
Johan's talk.
