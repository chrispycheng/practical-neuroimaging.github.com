Workflow
********

Principles
==========

Optimize for

* Efficiency
* Reliability
* Reproducibility

Make it as easy as possible to:

* Record changes
* Write and run tests
* Share code and data with other people

Components
==========

* The data directory
* Scripts
* Notebooks
* Library code

Suggested segmentation
======================

* data directory
* scripts / notebooks directory
* library code
