Reading for the class
#####################

If you are new to Python, we highly recommend reading `the Python tutorial`_ on
the main Python website.  It has a good pace for beginners.

There's a nice interactive web tutorial at
http://learnpython.org

There are some very fine tutorials on using Python for science at
https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures#online-read-only-versions

The book `Learning Python <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158071.do>`_
has got a bit too long in the current versions, but we have the pithy first
edition which is very well paced.  First come to office hours, first borrow.
