#################################
Software to install for the class
#################################

You will need Python and some Python scientific libraries installed.

If you already have some large Python packaging system installed, such as the
`Anaconda` or the `Enthought Python Distribution`_, you can stick with that,
it should provide the dependencies you need.  To make sure, see the relevant
instructions below for checking your installation.  If you don't have
something like that (most of you won't), please read on...

************************
If you are using Windows
************************

Download and install Python and packages using Python (X,Y)
===========================================================

Go the the Python (X,Y) website: https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/

Click on the Downloads link to take you to the Downloads page
(https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads).

Click on the link for the ConnectMV mirror (it appears to be in Canada, where
the other download links are in Europe).

Download the Python (X,Y) exe file, and double click to install.

Accept all the defaults.

Use pip to install the nibabel package
======================================

Open the ``cmd`` program program by clicking on the Windows Start button and
typing ``cmd`` (Return).

At the prompt, type::

    pip install nibabel

This will cause pip to install the ``nibabel`` package for reading
neuroimaging file formats.

Check the installation has worked
=================================

Download (right-click, save as) this Python script file to your computer:
https://nipy.bic.berkeley.edu/pna/check_pna_install.py

Open the cmd program again.  Change directory to the directory containing the
script file, e.g. ``cd Downloads``.

Run the script with::

    python check_pna_install.py

If you have any problems, follow the printed instructions after you run the
script, and let us know (see :ref:`installation-problems`).

Install git, the version control system
=======================================

Go to http://git-scm.com/

Click on the Downloads for Windows link at the bottom right.

Download the file they propose, with a filename something like
``Git-1.9.5-preview20141217.exe``.

Run the file to start the installation.

We suggest you accept the defaults, except the sceen called "Adjusting your
PATH environment", where we suggest you choose the option "Use git from the
Windows Command Prompt".

********************
If you are using OSX
********************

Download and install Python
===========================

Download the latest version of Python 2 from `Python downloads
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.  The current version at the time of
writing is Python 2.7.9.

Install in the usual way, by double clicking the installer, and following the
defaults.

Use pip to install the packages you need
========================================

Open the Terminal program by running ``Terminal.app`` (type command-space to
run spotlight or click on the spotlight icon and type ``terminal`` to find
this if you don't know where it is on your Mac).

At the Terminal.app prompt, type (or copy / paste)::

    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas ipython[notebook,test] nibabel

This will cause pip to install the named packages, including the ``nibabel``
package for reading neuroimaging file formats.

Check the installation has worked
=================================

Download (right-click, save as) this Python script file to your computer:
https://nipy.bic.berkeley.edu/pna/check_pna_install.py

Open the Terminal.app again if it is not already open.  Change directory to
the directory containing the script file, e.g. ``cd Downloads``.

Run the script with::

    python2.7 check_pna_install.py

If you have any problems, follow the printed instructions after you run the
script, and let us know (see :ref:`installation-problems`).

Install git, the version control system
=======================================

If you are on OSX 10.9 (Mavericks) or above
-------------------------------------------

On Mavericks and above, ``git`` comes with the Apple OSX command line tools.

To get these, type ``git`` at the terminal command line.  If git is not
installed already you will get a dialog box like this:

.. image:: images/git_developer_tools.png

Click 'install' to install the OSX developer command line tools, including
git.

If you are on OSX 10.8 (Mountain lion) or below
-----------------------------------------------

Install git from the `Git snow-leopard installer
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.2.1-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg/download>`_
by doing the usual routine of double clicking the ``.dmg`` file then
double-clicking the ``.pkg`` installer.  Check the installation has worked by
closing Terminal.app and opening again, and typing ``git`` at the command
line.
