Software to install for the class
#################################

* A text editor to edit python code
* Python and the Numpy package installed

In practice this is only likely to be a problem (for this first class)
for you, gentle Windows user.

************************
If you are using Windows
************************

Please install Python (X, Y) : http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/

You want the file ``Python(x,y)-2.7.3.1.exe`` - not the updates, but the full
release.

Choose the default installation options for now.

If you don't have a preferred editor for code, please install `Notepad++`_.

********************
If you are using OSX
********************

You will already have Python and Numpy installed with your System by Apple.
That will do for now.

If you do not have a text editor you prefer for editing code, consider
installing the `textmate`_ editor. There's a free `textmate download for UC
Berkeley`_.

**********************
If you are using Linux
**********************

You should be fine with  (Ubuntu or Debian)::

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy

On Fedora or related distros::

    yum install numpy

You will probably already have the editor ``gedit`` installed on your system, if
not, and you don't have a preferred editor, install it (Ubuntu / Debian : ``sudo
apt-get install gedit``, Fedora etc : ``yum install gedit``.
