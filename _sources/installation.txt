Software to install for the class
#################################

* A text editor to edit python code - see :ref:`choosing-editor`
* Python and the Python scientific libraries installed - see below.

If you already have some large Python packaging system installed, such as the
`Enthought Python Distribution`_, you can stick with that, it should provide the
dependencies you need.  To make sure, see :ref:`check-installation`. If you
don't have something like that (most of you won't), please read on...

************************
If you are using Windows
************************

Download and install Python version 2.7 from `Python downloads
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.


********************
If you are using OSX
********************

We have an exciting new installer for the course.  If you do not have Python.org
python 2.7, installed, or you aren't sure if you have it installed, please start
by running the installer at
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3-macosx10.6.dmg

Next, please try the fancy installer I built for this course, called *Reginald*.
Download ``reginald.dmg`` with right-click and ``Save link as`` from the `course
web directory`_.  Double click to mount the installer, then open the mounted
disk image and look at the ``ReadMe.txt`` file, and then double click the
installer.

Remember to :ref:`check-installation`

**********************
If you are using Linux
**********************

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian, please set up `NeuroDebian`_ using the
instructions on the NeuroDebian website.  Then::

    sudo apt-get install python-nipy
    sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook
    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-nose

On Fedora or related distros, it's a little more complicated::

    sudo yum install numpy scipy sympy python-setuptools
    sudo yum install python-matplotlib python-nose
    sudo yum install python-ipython-notebook
    sudo easy_install nibabel
    sudo easy_install nipy
