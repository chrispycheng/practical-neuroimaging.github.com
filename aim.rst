Aim of the course
#################

We aim to teach you how to work with data and with code so that you can get a
deeper understanding of how the methods work, how they can fail, how to fix
them, and how to develop new methods, if you need them.

We hope that you will come out of this course feeling comfortable working with
data from raw images to finished activation maps.  We will teach you the
standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses
more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce.

We'll use Python_ for most of the course, but the principles apply equally to
MATLAB_, and we'll also be using some MATLAB routines and standard packages such
as AFNI_, FSL_ and SPM_.
