Please read :doc:`this tutorial on convolution <on_convolution>`.

Day
***

* Making a model for the HRF;
* Making a neuronal model;
* Creating the convolution kernel by sampling from the HRF;
* Convolving to make hemodynamic time course;
* Extracting time series (slicing in 4th dimension);
* Correlating the convolved time course with the data.
* Writing our own correlation function.

    cd pna2015/day5
    git pull

Start with `hrf_convolution` notebook.

If you have time, go on to the `more_correlation` notebook.

Have fun.
