Practical neuroimaging analysis course
######################################

**Course director**: Professor Mark D'Esposito

**Instructors**: Dr Matthew Brett, Dr Jean-Baptiste Poline

The course is complementary to Mark D'Esposito's FMRI course in that we cover
some of the same theoretical material, but we aim to teach you how to work with
data and with code so that you can get a deeper understanding of how the methods
work, how they can fail, how to fix them, and how to develop new methods, if you
need them.

We intend that students will come out of this course feeling comfortable working
with data from raw images to finished activation maps.  We will teach you the
standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses
more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce.

We'll use Python for most of the course, but the principles apply equally to
MATLAB, and we'll also be using some MATLAB routines and standard packages such
as FSL and SPM.

It will be 2 hours weekly during the semester starting from the week of 10
February 2013. The format will be about 40 minutes of talking and 60 minutes of
hands-on practical work.

* Loading and manipulating images
* Image diagnostics
* Slice time correction by time interpolation
* Principles and practice of image registration
* Motion correction for FMRI
* Inter-modality registration
* Registration between subjects (spatial normalization)
* Smoothing
* The principles of linear regression
* Principles of convolution (for hemodynamic modeling)
* Single subject analysis
* Methods for correcting for multiple comparisons
* Multisubject analysis and random effects

Other subjects we may cover according to time and interest:

* Connectivity analysis methods
* Analyzing resting state data
* Machine learning / classification methods
* Diffusion imaging principles
* Diffusion imaging analysis including tractography

Reading and course-work will include online tutorials as posted on the class
website and writing example code, reviewed by the instructors.

The course provides one unit of credit.
