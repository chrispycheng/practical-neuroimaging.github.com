Donoho quote 0:

    "The scientific method’s central motivation is the ubiquity of error–the
    awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere
    and that the scientist’s effort is primarily expended in recognizing and
    rooting out error." (Donoho 2009 - see below)

Donoho quote 1:

    “In stark contrast to the sciences relying on deduction or empiricism,
    computational science is far less visibly concerned with the ubiquity of
    error. At conferences and in publications, it’s now completely acceptable
    for a researcher to simply say, ‘here is what I did, and here are my
    results.’ Presenters devote almost no time to explaining why the audience
    should believe that they found and corrected errors in their computations.
    The presentation’s core isn’t about the struggle to root out error — as it
    would be in mature fields — but is instead a sales pitch: an enthusiastic
    presentation of ideas and a breezy demo of an implementation. Computational
    science has nothing like the elaborate mechanisms of formal proof in
    mathematics or meta-analysis in empirical science. Many users of scientific
    computing aren’t even trying to follow a systematic, rigorous discipline
    that would in principle allow others to verify the claims they make. How
    dare we imagine that computational science, as routinely practiced, is
    reliable!”  (Donoho et al 2009 : Reproducible Research in Computational
    Harmonic Analysis)
