THINGS YOU LIKE BEST ABOUT THE COURSE SO FAR
--------------------------------------------

I appreciate the downloadable iPython notebooks with explanations of what the
code is and does - will be a great reference +3

I like the course website.

THINGS YOU THINK LEAST ABOUT THE COURSE SO FAR
----------------------------------------------

I think the course could move a little more quickly, with more emphasis being
placed on office hours when catch-up work is required.

It would be helpful to have a course outline at the outset so we know what to
expect.

STUFF YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT
-----------------------------------

It's helpful for a python newbie to hear how the data is structured; once we
have a baseline knowledge of what it is, it would help me to hear your workflow
of how to handle it. I assume we'll get to that, though.

ANY OTHER COMMENTS?
-------------------

It would be nice to have some specific projects/assignments to work on soon +3

It would be nice if you left some Inputs blank so that we could try writing a
couple of commands ourselves+2
